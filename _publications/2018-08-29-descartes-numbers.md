We call an odd positive integer $$n$$ a *Descartes number* if there exist positive integers $$k,m$$ such that $$n = km$$ and

$$\begin{equation} \sigma(k)(m+1) = 2km \end{equation}$$

Currently, $$\mathcal{D} = 3^{2}7^{2}11^{2}13^{2}22021$$ is the only known Descartes number. In $$2008$$, Banks et al. proved that $$\mathcal{D}$$ is the only cube-free Descartes number with fewer than seven distinct prime factors. In the present paper, we extend the methods of Banks et al. to show that there is no cube-free Descartes number with seven distinct prime factors.
