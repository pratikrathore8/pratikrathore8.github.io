I am a senior at the University of Maryland who is pursuing a double degree in mathematics and electrical engineering.

From those taken in by the five senses, to those emitted by distant stars, signals play a key role in our daily lives. As our world becomes more data-driven, new tools to separate signals from noise need to be developed. **My research interests are in developing new signal processing and machine learning algorithms.** In particular, I am interested in applying mathematics towards developing new theoretical framework in the areas of signal processing and machine learning, and using such framework towards solving real-world problems.

I am currently an intern at [Systems & Technology Research (STR)](https://stresearch.com), where I have developed target tracking and image processing algorithms for inverse synthetic aperture radar (ISAR) imaging. I am now part of a team at STR that is applying deep learning towards performing automatic target recognition on ISAR images.

In the past, I have worked at Lockheed Martin Space and at the Department of Mathematics at the University of Maryland. At Lockheed Martin, I reviewed several computational models for satellites. At the Department of Mathematics, I conducted research in Descartes Numbers, and [proved a new mathematical result](https://pratikrathore8.github.io/publication/2018-08-29-descartes-numbers).
