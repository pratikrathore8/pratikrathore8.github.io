About me
=====

I am an incoming PhD student in the Electrical Engineering department at Stanford.

I received a B.S. in Electrical Engineering and a B.S. in Mathematics from the University of Maryland in 2021. At Maryland, I was part of the University of Maryland's Putnam Math Competition team for three years. In 2018, the team [finished in 9th place](https://cmns.umd.edu/news-events/features/4388), its best performance in almost a decade, and I was ranked in the top 3% of all competitors. In high school, I qualified for the United States of America Mathematical Olympiad (USAMO).

In my free time, I enjoy cooking, working out, playing poker, and watching sports (especially the NBA).

Research interests
=====

From those taken in by the five senses, to those emitted by distant stars, signals play a key role in our daily lives. As our world becomes more data-driven, new tools to separate signals from noise need to be developed. **My research interests are in developing new machine learning and signal processing algorithms.** In particular, I am interested in applying mathematics towards developing new theoretical framework in the areas of machine learning and signal processing, and using such framework towards solving real-world problems.

From Summer 2020 to Summer 2021, I was an intern at [Systems & Technology Research (STR)](https://str.us). At STR, I developed tools for radar image processing, data generation for the training of automatic target recognition systems, and modeling and simulation of radar returns.

In the past, I have worked at [Lockheed Martin Space](https://www.lockheedmartin.com/en-us/capabilities/space.html) and at the Department of Mathematics at the University of Maryland. At Lockheed Martin, I reviewed several computational models for satellites. At the Department of Mathematics, I conducted research in Descartes Numbers, [proved a new mathematical result](https://pratikrathore8.github.io/publication/2018-08-29-descartes-numbers), and received the University of Maryland Dan Shanks Award for Research in Computational Number Theory.
